/* Disadvantage of Vanilla CSS

*-> Vanilla CSS styles are not "scoped" to Components 
-> to which they belong !
-> they are applied globally to the page
-> some css class can effect some other different components as well

? what we can do if we wanna achieve some scoping?
*-> one solution: Switch to "Inline-Styles"
   -> it means, apply them right in the JSX code

   FOR INSTANCE: 
   <p
      style={{
        color: 'red',
        textAlign: 'center',
      }}
    >
      A community of artists and art-lovers.
    </p>

   -> 1. take a dynamic value
   -> 2. then pass an object as a value to the style prop
   -> 3. apply css class as "key-value" pairs

* Advantage: 
  -> quick and easy to add 
  -> styles affect the element to which you add them
  -> dynamic (conditional) styling is simple

* Disadvantage: 
  -> you need to style every element individually
  -> no separation between css and jsx code
