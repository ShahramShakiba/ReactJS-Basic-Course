  [null, null, null],

   FROM this "turns-array"-> function GameBoard({ onSelectSquare, turns }){}

   *simply set gameBoard to initialGameBoard -> 
    let gameBoard = initialGameBoard;

    -> then overwrite this variable(gameBoard) with data derived from "turns" if we have turns

    -> use a "for loop"-> if turns is an empty array this loop won't execute
    -> in that loop-> extract info about the turns that occurred from that object that we're storing in this turns-array:

    ! most probably we get an error
    -> we're deriving our gameBoard based on the gameTurns

    -> gameTurns-state updated in handleSelectSquare, which we're storing info about selected square with -rowIndex & colIndex-

    -> which we get them as an input on handleSelectSquare

    -> and handleSelectSquare passed as a value through the onSelectSquare prop to GameBoard

    -> and there it has set as an value onClick

    -> onClick does not give us -rowIndex & colIndex- data

    -> to make sure the info about which row and which column was clicked

    -> we should use onSelectSquare as a anonymous-function

    -> so we get full control on how onSelectSquare will be executed

    -> now we can pass rowIndex, colIndex as an argument to this function
    *    <button onClick={() => onSelectSquare(rowIndex, colIndex)}>

      -> so in the end, to this function "handleSelectSquare"
      -> since that's the value for this on select square prop

        const thirdSquareSymbol =
      }

     => I simply extract the symbol I have on my gameBoard for the different elements that make up one winning combination

-> the gameBoard is inside of the GameBoard-component, therefore I lift-up the code where we compute the gameBoard and I add it to App component (deriving the gameBoard in the App-component)

    this code->  let gameBoard = initialGameBoard;       👈
                 for (const turn of turns) {
                    const { square, player } = turn;
                    const { row, col } = square;

                    gameBoard[row][col] = player;
                  }

    also this->  const initialGameBoard = [         👈
                    [null, null, null],
                    [null, null, null],
                    [null, null, null],
                  ];

* do some small changes: 
for (const turn of turns) into=> for (const turn of gameTurns){}     👈

<GameBoard turns={gameTurns} /> into=> <GameBoard board={gameBoard}   👈
   -> which gets the gameBoard which I'm now deriving here in the App-component as a value

in GameBoard-component-> function GameBoard({ onSelectSquare, board }) {}   👈
     <ol id="game-board">
    👉 {board.map((row, rowIndex) => (
        ......
      ))}
    </ol>

    -> it's no longer computing that value inside of this component, instead we computing the value in the App component


* the advantage of doing this:
-> now we have that gameBoard here, and we can now extract the different symbols that are stored in that gameBoard in the positions that are "defined by our winning-combinations"

-> we can get hold of the symbol that's stored in the first square of this specific winning combinations by accessing gameBoard which is that multi-dimensional array
              ->  const firstSquareSymbol = gameBoard[]   👈


*-> const firstSquareSymbol = gameBoard[combination[0].row]
-> combination = is on of the combinations in "winning-combinations.js"
-> [0] = is the first element  [
                              👉 { row: 0, column: 0 }, 👈
                                 { row: 0, column: 1 },
                                 { row: 0, column: 2 },
                               ],

                               or this one and so on ....

                               [
                               👉 { row: 1, column: 0 }, 👈
                                  { row: 1, column: 1 },
                                  { row: 1, column: 2 },
                               ],

                               and now we're extracting the "row"

          * -> we do this for "column" as well,like this:
           for (const combination of WINNING_COMBINATIONS) {
              const firstSquareSymbol =
                gameBoard[combination[0].row][combination[0].column];
              const secondSquareSymbol =
                gameBoard[combination[1].row][combination[1].column];
              const thirdSquareSymbol =
                gameBoard[combination[2].row][combination[2].column];
            }
              
            -> so that, step by step, we go through the different squares that make up one winning-combination and we take a look at the symbols that are stored in our gameBoard in these different squares

*-> now check if they're all equal because we know that the game is over if for a possible winning-combination all symbols are equal :
let winner;

if (
      firstSquareSymbol &&
      firstSquareSymbol === secondSquareSymbol &&
      firstSquareSymbol === thirdSquareSymbol
    ) {
      winner = firstSquareSymbol;
}

<!-- 
  function GameOver({ winner }) {

}

? [in App.jsx]
{winner && <GameOver winner={winner} />}     👈
<GameBoard onSelectSquare={handleSelectSquare} board={gameBoard} />

* handle the "draw" condition
-> we have draw if we populated all fields, we know that we'll always have exactly "9 fields"
-> at most we have 9 gameTurns

 => const hasDraw = gameTurns.length === 9 && !winner;

 => {(winner || hasDraw) && <GameOver winner={winner} />}
