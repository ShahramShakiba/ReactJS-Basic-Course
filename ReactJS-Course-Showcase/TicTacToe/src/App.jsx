/* EXTRA Information

? Reusing Component:
whenever you are using or reusing a component, React will basically create a new isolated instance, for instance:

-> <Player name="Player 1" symbol="X" />
-> <Player name="Player 2" symbol="O" />
These two component work totally isolated from each other

* important feature in React
Having this isolation allows you to build super complex reusable components
