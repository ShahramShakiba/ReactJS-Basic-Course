/* Reusing Component:
* Reusing Component
whenever you are using or reusing a component, React will basically create a new isolated instance, for instance:

-> <Player name="Player 1" symbol="X" />
-> <Player name="Player 2" symbol="O" />
These two component work totally isolated from each other

? important feature in React
Having this isolation allows you to build super complex reusable components

01-> update turns: the new turns array will depend on the old turns array
  -> we should update this ina an immutable way
  -> the first item should always be the latest turn
  -> store an Object here, so that our "gameTurns" state will eventually be an array full of objects

?-> finally, we want to know "which player" clicked on "which square"
02-> if we use "activePlayer"-state we're technically merging two different states and it's "not optimal"

  -> better way: of deriving the "symbol of the currently activePlayer" is to add a new variable here in this function that we're passing to the state updating function

* if (prevTurns.length > 0 && prevTurns[0].player === 'X') {}
?-> prevTurns[0] : 
    in our previous-turns array if the first element in there, which will always be the latest turn 

?-> prevTurns[0].player === 'X' : 
    if that turn was performed by the player with the "symbol X" and if that's the case we set the currenPlayer to "O"

?-> prevTurns.length > 0 :
    there might be no latest turn stored - initially it's an empty array ->
    const [gameTurns, setGameTurns] = useState([]);

?-> return updatedTurns; :
    return as a new value for the "gameTurns-state"


* It is a state update function that makes sure that we update-state in an "immutable-way" and that we're not "merging different states"

/* Reducing State Management
* Identifying Unnecessary State

-> we already have this "gameTurns-state" which changes whenever a box is selected
-> so we don't need this activePlayer-state just to trigger a UI when that happens ⬇️

?-> function App() { 
?->   setActivePlayer((curActivePlayer) => (

?->      {the rest of the code....}
?->   }

-> BUT, we need the information regarding which players is the "active-player"
-> we can get this info from our gameTurns-state

-> now, we can use a helper function which won't need any access to the state or any other data related to the component and also, shouldn't be recreated when the component function re-executes ⬇️

?-> function deriveActivePlayer(gameTurns) {
?->   let currentPlayer = 'X';
?->   if (gameTurns.length > 0 && gameTurns[0].player === 'X') {
?->     currentPlayer = 'O';
?->    }

?->   return currentPlayer;
?->  }

-> use the current-gameTurns-state

-> back to our "App-Component", create a variable which holds the result of calling "derivedActivePlayer" ⬇️
?-> const activePlayer = deriveActivePlayer(gameTurns);

-> pass our state "gameTurns" as an argument to "deriveActivePlayer" so in there it is available

-> THEN in state-updating-function "setGameTurns" -> set our currenPlayer by calling "deriveActivePlayer" ⬇️
?-> const currentPlayer = deriveActivePlayer(prevTurns);

-> with passing "prevTurns" as an argument

* Manage as little state as possible and derive and compute as many values as needed
