?-> Now I need to some logic to get hold that value

?-> manage all inputs with one state
    that kind of merges all these different input values into "one-object"
*/

/* function
?-> Then we need a function
    that should be triggered whenever we change the value

*-> why we update state based on previous state?
     when this function executes, only one of these 4 properties will be updated, therefore, the other properties and their value shouldn't be lost

?-> I need to override "one single property" of that object

       - annualInvestment
       - expectedReturn
       - duration

     dynamically set a property depending on which value is stored in "inputIdentifier"

?  onChange={handleChange}
-> you don't call the function -> handleChange()
-> you just pass it as a value

-> when you're getting the value of an input-field
-> that value when extracted will always be a "string"
-> even if you set the type to "number"-> type="number"
-> this does not influence the type of value, you're getting in JavaScript
-> instead, you're always getting a value type "string"

?=> simply adding this plus will force a conversion of this string value to a number value
