/* Props vs Context
* Props :
  for Configuration

* Context :
  for State Management across components or possibly across the entire App
  for replacing long prop chains
  ? Limitation:
    - React Context is NOT optimized for high frequency changes
      you have state changes that happen much more frequently - multiple changes
      per second
