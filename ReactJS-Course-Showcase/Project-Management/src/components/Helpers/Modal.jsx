/* Make it flexible and reusable
* Now it should become even more flexible and reusable.
I wanna make sure that we can open this dialog by calling a function that should be exposed by my custom component that does not require the calling component.

So another component that uses the modal to know that a dialog is used internally.
That should not be information that's needed by the component that uses my modal component.

by using two features provided by React:
*1. the forwardRef feature,
*2. the useImperativeHandle hook :
To now expose a function that can be called from outside this component function, we must use useImperativeHandle.
